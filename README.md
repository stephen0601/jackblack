# Jackblack
This program allows the user to play a card game of JackBlack, a variation of Blackjack that I created. As the objective of Blackjack is to have a count closest to 21, Jackblack reverses the objective as you try to go to 0 by finding the difference. 

As the game begins, random cards will be dealt to the user and the top card of the dealer will be revealed to the user. The difference between the two cards will be shown and the user will be asked if they want to hit. If the user agrees, another random card will be dealt to the user. If the card that is hit makes the user's value negative, the user busts and loses the hand. There is an active counter to see how many wins the dealers and the user has and it's compared to see who has more wins. After each hand the user is asked if they want to continue, depending on the user's answer the scanner will continue the game or display a goodbye message.
