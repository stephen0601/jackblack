# Jackblack
Jackblack is a game I created that is the reverse of Blackjack, instead of trying to have either get 21 or have cards that have the sum greater than the dealer, Jackblack compares the difference between the user and the dealer. The two cards that the user draws subtract from eachother and the cards compare to the dealers.
